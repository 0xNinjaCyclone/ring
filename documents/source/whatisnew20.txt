	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Functions

Better Functions
================

* isWindows64() function - Better Code
* print() function - Better code to handle apostrophe inside text
* random() function - Produce numeric output when the parameter is a negative number or zero
* reverse() function - Beside supporting lists, the function now support strings too
* add() function - when adding a list support adding each item alone
* list2str() function - Support more parameters: list2str(aList,[nStart],[nEnd])
* isDigit(), isAlpha(), isAlnum(), etc. will return False if the input is an empty string
* number() function - Produce runtime error if the string contains invalid number
* input() function - If the size is not passed as parameter it will read a line
* locals() function - Usage in global scope will not return predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* Swap() function - Support swaping any two Lists/Objects

	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Enable/Disable Hash Comments

Enable/Disable Hash Comments
============================

We added the next two commands to the Ring Scanner

* EnableHashComments
* DisableHashComments

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	DisableHashComments
	#define = 10
	EnableHashComments
	# Just a comment
	DisableHashComments
	? #define
	EnableHashComments
	# End of program

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Performance when using Braces

Better Performance when using Braces
====================================

Using braces to access objects is 120% faster in Ring 1.20

Using normal functions or using the dot operator still faster than using braces, but this update is a step forward towards reducing the gap.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Support for Threads

Better Support for Threads
==========================

* Better code inside Ring VM for starting new threads 
* Better code for sharing the Memory Pool information between threads 
* Each thread have it's copy from predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* Ring lists that wraps C pointers will not use internal dynamic cache
* Ring lists created using List() will not use internal dynamic cache if size is not changed

.. note:: Ring Lists that avoid internal dynamic cache provide safe reading from many threads because accessing lists for reading will not include implicit writing to the internal cache.

	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Scripts for Building Ring

Better Scripts for Building Ring
================================

* Scripts for building Ring Compiler/VM are moved to ring/language/build folder
* Scripts for building Ring, Extensions and Tools are moved to ring/build folder 
* File: language/src/installdep.sh - Added: libqt5multimedia5-plugins
* Added: ring/language/build/buildzig.bat
* Added: ring/build/buildgcc.sh
* Added: ring/build/buildclang.sh

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Improving Ring Compiler/VM Source Code

Improving Ring Compiler/VM Source Code
======================================

* Better Format
* Using constants
* Use Bit Fields in structures
* Structures Members - Better names
* Structures Members - Better order  
* Functions Parameters - Better names
* language/src/rstring.c - ring_string_set2_gc() - Better code
* language/src/os_e.c - randomize() - Better code
* language/src/expr.c - ring_parser_ppmm() - Better code

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Tools and Extensions

Better Tools and Extensions
===========================

* RingThreads - Better code for creating the Mutex
* RingQt - Added: QComponent class (Qt3DCore)
* RingQt - Correct parent class name for the QMaterial & QLogicAspect classes
* Ring extension for VSCode is updated to support modern versions of VSCode

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; More Improvements

More Improvements
=================

* Ring VM - Avoid infinite for loops when the step value is zero 
* Ring VM - Remove old code related to lAddSubListsByMove and lAddSubListsByFastCopy in VM structure 
* Ring VM - Return command - Better code when we return an object passed to the function as parameter
* Ring VM - Return command - Better code when we return class attribute by reference 
* Ring VM - Better support for try/catch and different operators
* Ring VM - Better support for try/catch when creating new object and the parent class doesn't exist
* Ring VM - When we compare between a string and a number take in mind if the string contains extra characters
* Ring VM - Treat lists that wrap C pointers as FALSE if the C pointer value is NULL
* Ring VM - Loop N command inside For-In loop will execute implicit Exit N-1 command then Loop
