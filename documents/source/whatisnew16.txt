Light GUILib 
============

A lot of RingQt applications uses only QtCore, QtGui & QtWidget modules

These applications could use

.. code-block:: ring

	load "lightguilib.ring"

Instead of

.. code-block:: ring

	load "guilib.ring"

Also Ring Notepad, Distribute menu comes with a new option : Distribute light RingQt application

Using this option we can distribute lightguilib applications

For example, Distributing (Game of Life) using this option provides : target/windows folder 

.. image:: lightguilib.png
	:alt: lightguilib

* Size : 35 MB (Uncompressed)
* Size : 13 MB (zip)
* Size : 9 MB (exe) compressed using 7zip

So we can distribute these GUI applications using an installer less than 10 MB

.. tip:: if you need something smaller than that (1 MB) then switch to other libraries like LibUI

Nested methods call in separate lines
=====================================

In Ring 1.16, the Compiler support adding new lines after the method call and before the dot operator

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	myobj = new Start
	myobj.one()
	     .two()
	     .three()
	     .go()

	class start
		func one
			? "One"
			return new one


	class one 
		func two
			? "Two"
			return new two

	class two
		func three
			? "Three"
			return new three

	class three
		func go
			? "Go!"

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	One
	Two
	Three
	Go!
