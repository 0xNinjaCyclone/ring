# Introduction 

In this document we talk about the progress in PWCT 2.0 development.

This document contains some news (Not a complete description of the product)

PWCT is a General-Purpose Visual Programming Language (http://pwct.org)

The current generation (PWCT 1.0 - PWCT 1.9) works under Microsoft Windows 

We started this generation fifteen years ago (In Dec. 2005)

Video about the First Generation (In 2013) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpxbfPxNHqg

We learned a lot of things from this generation based on feedback from thousands of
developers all over the world.

We used the first genertion (PWCT 1.9) to develop the Ring language Compiler and VM.

# The Second Generation

The second generation (PWCT 2.0) is under development using the Ring programming language

Our goal is to provide a more powerful version of the software that satisfy two conditions

(1) To be an easy tool to start learning about real programming concepts

(2) To be a better replacement for Textual Code Editors 

In the first generation we tried to do the same things, we did a lot of mistakes, we 
learned from them, we developed new ideas, and we implemented these ideas in PWCT 2.0

I could be brave and say that after PWCT 2.0, I don't see any reason to use a Textual Code Editor
when developing Ring applications. The same could be applied for other programming languages when we 
support them.

# The Concept

# Web and Mobile versions

We can use PWCT on Desktop, Web & Mobile platforms.

The next screen shot for the Mobile & Web versions

The Web version uses (Qt For WebAssembly) and the Mobile version uses (Qt for Android)

Most software developers uses the Desktop platforms and I belive that this is too much
better and practical. but we added the support to these platforms for two reasons

1- We can easily support them (Thanks to the powerful Ring language & Qt framework)

2- At some situations, these platforms are very useful. 

2.1 - Some uses don't have desktop computers but have Mobile devices.

2.2 - At some places we could have only our Mobile devices and some free time for programming.

The Mobile screen is small, typing using the touch screen is slow
compared to using a large keyboard.

Using foldable smartphones and Tablets provide better experience.

# Translation (Arabic Version)

One of the advantages of using Visual Programming and GUI over textual code editors is the easy translation

of these User Interfaces to other natural languages.

PWCT 2.0 will comes with an Arabic version, other languages could be added in the future.

# The Release Date

Since we already have the first generation of the product (PWCT 1.9) we decided that in
the second generation we will focus on the quality and accept the high costs (Development Time).

Until now the product is usable and a lot of useful ideas are implemented and we are happy with
the product, It's too much better than the first generation but, we are going to invest 
more time to provide many useful resources around the software.

Once we have a fixed release date we will update this document.

The more we are investing our time in the development of this product, the more we save
your time when you use it.
