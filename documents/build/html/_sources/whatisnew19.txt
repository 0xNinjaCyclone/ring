.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.19; Hours Counter application

Hours Counter application
=========================

This is a simple calculator for teaching hours

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.19; Ring for Windows 64bit 

Ring for Windows 64bit 
======================

Starting from Ring 1.19 the default Ring for Windows version is 64bit

This provide access to more memory. Also, most of our tests indicates an increase of performance by 25%

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.19; Better batch files for building Ring

Better batch files for building Ring 
====================================

Using ring/buildvc.bat and ring/buildvc_x64.bat we can build everything (Ring Compiler/VM, Extensions, Tools, etc.) for Windows 32bit or 64bit

Ring comes with all of the dependencies except Qt

These batch files assume that we have Qt 5.15.15 (We can change the used Qt 5.15 version using the environment variables). 

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.19; Faster For Loop

Faster For Loop
===============

The For Loop in Ring 1.19 (32 bit) is 2.9 times faster than Ring 1.18 (32 bit)

Tested using Victus Laptop [13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700H, Windows 11]

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	t1= clock()
	for t=1 to 100_000_000 next
	t2 = clock()
	? (t2-t1)/clockspersecond()

Time using Ring 1.18 (32bit) : 3.78 seconds

Time using Ring 1.19 (32bit) : 1.31 seconds

Time using Ring 1.19 (64bit) : 1.12 seconds

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.19; More Samples

More Samples
============

* Added: samples/Language/Constants
* Added: samples/UsingQt/CustomDragAndDrop/customdraganddrop.ring 
* Added: samples/UsingMatrixLib/59-Matrix-Transform-Draw-Rotation.ring
