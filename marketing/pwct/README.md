Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) 2.0
================================================

Last Update: 2021.04.30

# Introduction 

In this folder we talk about the progress in PWCT 2.0 development.

PWCT is a General-Purpose Visual Programming Language (http://pwct.org)

The current generation (PWCT 1.0 - PWCT 1.9) works under Microsoft Windows 

We started this generation fifteen years ago (In Dec. 2005)

Video about the First Generation (In 2013) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpxbfPxNHqg

We learned a lot of things from this generation based on feedback from thousands of
developers all over the world.

We used the first genertion (PWCT 1.9) to develop the Ring language Compiler and VM.

The second generation (PWCT 2.0) is under development using the Ring programming language

Our goal is to provide a more powerful version of the software that satisfy two conditions

(1) To be the best tool to start learning about programming concepts

(2) To be a better replacement for textual code editors 

In the first generation we tried to do the same things, we did a lot of mistakes, we 
learned from them, we developed new ideas, and we implemented these ideas in PWCT 2.0

I could be brave and say that after PWCT 2.0, I don't see any reason to use a Textual Code Editor
when developing Ring applications. The same could be applied for other programming languages when we 
support them.

# Screen Shots

We can use PWCT on Desktop, Web & Mobile platforms.

The Web version uses (Qt For WebAssembly) and the Mobile version uses (Qt for Android)
